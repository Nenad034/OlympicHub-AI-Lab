Introduction
The InterlookIntegrationService API uses the SOAP protocol. SoapUI also can be used to invoke API methods.
Decryption of server errors
If data sent in a request to the service is sent in an incorrect format, in the response of any method the server will return an error indicating in which line in the XML the error is.
"There is an error in the XML document (12, 49)." - in this case, the error is in line 12, in total 49 characters in the line have the error.
In the SoapUI interface, when the cursor is placed anywhere in the request, the line number and the character number in the line are displayed in the right corner of the window.
 

•	Date error. Format: DateTime
Request: <meg:DateFrom>2021-10-010</meg:DateFrom> Response: The server could not read the request. ---> System.InvalidOperationException: There is an error in the XML document (11, 47). ---> System.FormatException: String "2021-10-010" is not a valid AllXsd value

•	Error in the data. Format: Integer
Request: <meg:PageSize>100000f</meg:PageSize> Response: The server could not read the request. ---> System.InvalidOperationException: There is an error in the XML document (9, 37). ---> System.FormatException: The input string had an incorrect format
The Methods of IntegrationService
The Authentication methods
Connect (Obtaining an authentication token)
Method obtains the authentication token required to execute the CreateReservation method. Accepted request parameters ( * – required):

Login * – login of the online user
Password * – online user's password
The Returning result:
Connecresult – authentication ID (if authentication was successful, we receive the ID, otherwise we receive the error "Connection result code: -1. Invalid login or password")

Example

The Invocation of method Connect
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:meg="http://www.megatec.ru/">

</soap:Envelope>

СheckConnect (Checking the connection activity under a specific identifier)
The method checks whether there is an active connection under a specific authentication identifier. Accepted request parameters ( * – required):
Guid * – authentication ID (returns when requesting the Connect method)

The returning result: 
CheckConnectResult – authentication ID (true – if the connection is active, false – if there is no connection)

Methods for working with tours
CreateReservation (The booking of the tour)
The method makes a booking of the tour
After receiving the authentication ID when requesting the Connect method, it should take some time for the cache to load. If a booking request is generated, when the cache is not loaded yet, the user receives the message "System.Exception: The Cache is loading. Try again after some time". In this case, you need to wait a few seconds and repeat the request. Attention! Booking of mandatory Extra Services like WithCost, Hardlink occurs automatically. Regardless of whether they are transmitted in the request or not.
Rebooking of a tour occurs if the request contains the parameters ExternalId, ID is already available in the Interlook database.

GetReservationMessages (Receiving messages for the reservation)
The method receives messages for a specific reservation.
Accepted request parameters ( * – required):
•	Guid * – id of authentification (returns in request for method Connect)
•	DgKey * – reservation key
•	MessageDirection * – message location directory (default value 1)
Returning results:
•	DogovorMessageItem – search result
•	Id – message ID
•	IsOutgouing – outgoing (true - outgoing, false - incoming)
•	DogovorId – reservation number
•	DateCreate – date the message was created
•	senderName – the sender's name
•	isRead – read (true - read, false - not read)
•	TourOperKey – tour operator's key
•	Processed – processing status
•	Text – the text of the message
In case of an error, a transcript of the error will be received.
If there is an error in the Guid, we get the message: "Invalid user or password (Invalid GUID)".
If there is an error in the reservation key, we will receive the message: "Check the parameter 'dgKey' = <value in the request>. There is no any reservation for you in the database".
If there are no messages in the selected directory, we will get the answer: "Ok. There is no any message with 'messageDirection' = <value in the request>".

The method retrieves possible accommodation options according to the request parameters.

•	Request – object with request parameters
•	PageSize * – the page size of the returning data, that is, how many calculated prices to stop at and give the search result. If PageSize = 5 is set, then the search will go by prices and as soon as it gets 5 calculated (but it can sort through prices more, not all prices are suitable) prices, it will output them as a result. The number of sorted internal prices will be displayed in the TotalCount line.
•	RowIndexFrom * – from which line the result must be output from. For the first page, specify RowIndexFrom = 0 – the search starts from the very first price. To get the second page or subsequent search pages in RowIndexFrom, you need to pass the internal price number at which the search for the previous price page stopped (this number will be in the response in the TotalCount line)
•	DateFrom * – date "From"
•	DateTo * – date "To"
•	RegionKeys – ids of regions (if cities and hotels are not specified – search wiil be made for all regions, RegionKeys or CityKeys or HotelKeys must be filled in)

Accepted request parameters ( * – required):
•	Guid * – id of authentification (returns in request for method Connect)
•	Request – object with request parameters
•	PageSize * – from which line to output the result. For the first page, specify RowIndexFrom = 0 – the search starts from the very first price. To get the second page or subsequent search pages in Row Index From, you need to pass the internal price number at which the search for the previous price page stopped (this number will be in the response in the totalCount line)
•	RowIndexFrom * – from which line the result must be output from. For the first page, specify RowIndexFrom = 0 – the search starts from the very first price. To get the second page or subsequent search pages in RowIndexFrom, you need to pass the internal price number at which the search for the previous price page stopped (this number will be in the response in the TotalCount line)
•	DateFrom * – date "From"
•	DateTo * – date "To"
•	RegionKeys – ids of regions (if cities and hotels are not specified – search wiil be made for all regions, RegionKeys or CityKeys or HotelKeys must be filled in)

•	CacheGuid - the search ID that speeds up the navigation through the pages. You don't need to transmit it during the first search. The search will return this ID in the ResponseGuid parameter. Then, using paging, we transmit this ID further (but only within the framework of one search!)
•	ResultView – the type of output of the result (1 – sorting by daily price with grouping by hotels, 2 – sorting by daily price)
•	QuotaTypes – filter by quota type (0 – request, 1 – quota, 2 – stop). We get all possible results. If not specified, the value=0
•	Mode – do not specify or specify 0
