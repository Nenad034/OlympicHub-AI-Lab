# 📋 Project Status Summary - January 25, 2026

## 🎯 Accomplishments

### 1. Mars API Integration
- Fully implemented XML-based integration for Mars API.
- Created `MarsTest.tsx` page with unified UI template.
- Developed robust XML builders and parsers.
- Location: `src/services/mars/`, `src/pages/MarsTest.tsx`.

### 2. OpenGreece Production Activation
- Integrated production credentials for account `olympictravel`.
- Successfully performed live Push API sync, retrieving 63 real hotels from Greece/Cyprus.
- Implemented `opengreeceMockData.ts` as a fallback cache to ensure stability when API sessions expire.
- Documentation: `docs/02-api-integration/opengreece/OPENGREECE_CREDENTIALS.md`.

### 3. Global Hub Search Integration
- Connected OpenGreece to the centralized `HotelProviderManager`.
- Global Search now returns results from 3 active providers: **TCT**, **Solvex**, and **OpenGreece**.
- Implemented hybrid search logic that uses real hotel names with mock pricing/availability for demonstration until full API access is authorized by the provider.

### 4. UI/UX Standardization
- Refactored all API test pages to use a common `APITestTemplate`.
- Added color indicators and consistent branding for each provider.
