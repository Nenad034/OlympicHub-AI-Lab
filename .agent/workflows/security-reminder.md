# 🔒 Security Protocol Reminder

## IMPORTANT: Read This Before Every Task

Before starting ANY development work on Olympic Hub, you MUST:

1. **Read and follow:**
   ```
   docs/04-security/AI_AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md
   ```

2. **Consult:**
   - `docs/04-security/SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`
   - `TODO_LIST.md` (for priorities)
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (for structure)

3. **Before completing ANY task:**
   - Run Self-Reflection Checklist from AI_AGENT_MASTER_PROMPT.md
   - Verify no security violations
   - Check that all best practices are followed

## Quick Self-Check

□ No `.env` files in commit  
□ No hardcoded credentials  
□ Input validation implemented  
□ Error handling in place  
□ TypeScript types defined  
□ Security checklist reviewed

**This workflow ensures consistent, secure, production-grade code.**
